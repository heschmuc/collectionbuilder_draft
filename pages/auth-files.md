{% include feature/nav-menu.html sections="Subjects;Dietary;Shorthand" %}
This is the page with the lists of words to be used for the metadata fields of Subjects and Dietary and substitutions for the shorthand words within the ingredients list and directions of the recipe. You should always check this page before creating your metadata. If the recipe requires a new word for either the subject or dietary field, you should add it to the correct section of this page. However, avoid any overlaps and synonyms. Only add new wordsto the metadata when absolutely necessary.

### Subjects
The subjects field describes the type of recipe which is written on the card. This includes two sections: the type of dish a recipe is and a more descriptive portion detailing either when the dish is usually eaten, or the general type of food it is.

### Shorthand
This section provides lists of longform words to put into the Ingredients and Directions metadata fields in place of the shorthand terms which are used to save space on the physical recipe card. You can use this section to determine what word to use if there is any confusion.
Not all recipes have the same shorthand versions. If you come across a new term at any time, add it to this list for future reference.
